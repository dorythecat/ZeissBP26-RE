## 11/2/2025 - The BP26: Well built, but painful to reverse engineer  

I had this Zeiss CNC controller laying around, plus a really cool membrane "keyboard" I wanted to use for my own projects, but the Zeiss controller uses a proprietary connector (though I think it's based on RS-232 serial interface), so I need to reverse engineer it, as well as the membrane "keyboard", which I need a PCB to interface with, and I plan to 3D print an enclosure for.

The controller, which is where I'm starting this project, is a Zeiss BP26, with the latest firmware. I discovered that these go for like a thousand US dollars each, so I do not believe this will be an accessible project, but I wanna set a precedent so people that also find one of these can use them for themselves without the official equipment.

Anyways, this controller is really well built, and it's really accessible. The whole bottom pops off with four self-locking screws, and you can simply unplug the DB-15 port and remove the power switch from its holder. The final objective of this is to have a full recreation of the PCB that is as accurate as possible, as well as to hopefully dump the firmware, if I can. After removing the bottom, we get to see that this whole thing is a single massive PCB. It is glued to the front panel so observing its backside will be difficult, and a task for future me. For now,  I wanna concentrate on the port.

The port on the leftmost side on this image was the one connected to the serial. There is another similar port, which even has some pins in line with this port, but I do not yet have any ideas on what it can be used for. There's also a jumper for each port, but only the one on the connected port is bridged, so I kinda assume that has something to do.

After a bit of experimenting with the traces marked GND and VCC on the right hand side, I discovered a way of turning this on, by hooking it up to 5V (sorry for the blurry photo):

The problem with this, as you might be able to see, is that it doesn't require the power switch to be pressed down, and it also bypasses the emergency switch, both things that I fear shouldn't happen. Also, all the LEDs on board turn on, which I don't know yet if it's a failsafe or just a bug.

My next step is going to be trying to find the pins I need to interface with for the MAX232 chip this board has, and try to use the Glasgow to interface with it, see if I can read and/or write anything to it. Let's hope for the best...  

## 11/3/2025 - The pain goes on  

So, to no one's surprise, this proprietary machine does not have much info online. This means I've had to be just trying to figure out where everything goes, but not being able to see the backside of the PCB has so far been a major impediment. I'm working towards a full disassembly, so I can get the PCB all by itself, but, on the meantime, I've been trying stuff. I hooked up a logic analyzer, and my Glasgow Interface Explorer, and I'm now testing to see where each pin goes, and what it does (or does not) do. So far it's been pretty inconclusive so... Yeah, I need to keep trying, even if this is taking waaaay longer than I thought (and wanted it to) last :'(

## 11/4/2025 - Fully disassembled the controller, and breaking my head  

Welp this is being fun, both in the literal, and in the sarcastic sense. I have fully removed the joysticks and buttons from the PCB, so all that remains is this board that is permanently sandwiched to the front controls, at least as far as my knowledge goes. It is NOT ideal, but, we work with what we have.

It has been a bit grueling, but I have gotten at least a good amount far into reverse engineering this. I am working on learning what each pin on the connector leads to, and the secondary connector has been a huge help, since I have been able to make a few educated guesses about some pins thanks to it.

For now I only know that pins 7, 10, and 13 are directly plugged into ground, that pins 8 and 9 act as VIN, going off to a linear voltage regulator that can take quite a voltage, and then pins 3 and 14 are hooked up to the E-STOP directly, so that is nice to know.

Anyways,  here's to hoping that I will get some results out of this soon. >:3

## 11/6/2025 - Continued the journey  

Welp this is being painful, but also really fun. Progress is really slow, because, well, it's a PCB of which I can only see one side. There's a lot of guessing (and even more missing) involved, and my tools sometimes decide they do not like the idea of cooperating with me. Anyways, it feels like I'm not going as slow as I expected either. I'm starting to get a pretty good map, if by pieces, of where everything is connected to, and improving upon old knowledge. Let's hope it continues this way, and that it doesn't take too long to have something at least *slightly* functional...

## 11/8/2025 - Extracted the chips, and got a better look at the logic  

So, I've been doing some slightly riskier stuff. First, I wanted to check out the buzzer, since I thought "Hey, if I can track that down, I can probably guess what triggers it every time it turns on!" and that only led me to discover the mess that this is. The buzzer is wired permanently to VCC, but it is connected to gnd through a NOT gate. Which, first of all, you really did not need to use a quad not chip, that's really wasteful, and second, what the actual fuck? This feels like a crime.

Anyways, that didn't lead too far, but I continued investigating the logic. Apparently it is using a few D Flip-Flops and some other logic gates for *something*, which I yet have to investigate further. For now.

What I did after giving up on understanding this, when my brain started turning to mush, was trying to get the processor and the firmware EEPROM out of the board. In my mind, this was an easy task. In reality, this plastic is so old and brittle that I almost fucked up the entire firmware EEPROM's socket. Eventually, I got them out, but not without some pain inflicted upon my poor little heart. So, that was fun... Remind me why I torture myself like this once again?!?
