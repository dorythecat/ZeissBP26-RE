## 11/2/2025 - The BP26: Well built, but painful to reverse engineer  

I had this Zeiss CNC controller laying around, plus a really cool membrane "keyboard" I wanted to use for my own projects, but the Zeiss controller uses a proprietary connector (though I think it's based on RS-232 serial interface), so I need to reverse engineer it, as well as the membrane "keyboard", which I need a PCB to interface with, and I plan to 3D print an enclosure for.

The controller, which is where I'm starting this project, is a Zeiss BP26, with the latest firmware. I discovered that these go for like a thousand US dollars each, so I do not believe this will be an accessible project, but I wanna set a precedent so people that also find one of these can use them for themselves without the official equipment.

Anyways, this controller is really well built, and it's really accessible. The whole bottom pops off with four self-locking screws, and you can simply unplug the DB-15 port and remove the power switch from its holder. The final objective of this is to have a full recreation of the PCB that is as accurate as possible, as well as to hopefully dump the firmware, if I can. After removing the bottom, we get to see that this whole thing is a single massive PCB. It is glued to the front panel so observing its backside will be difficult, and a task for future me. For now,  I wanna concentrate on the port.

The port on the leftmost side on this image was the one connected to the serial. There is another similar port, which even has some pins in line with this port, but I do not yet have any ideas on what it can be used for. There's also a jumper for each port, but only the one on the connected port is bridged, so I kinda assume that has something to do.

After a bit of experimenting with the traces marked GND and VCC on the right hand side, I discovered a way of turning this on, by hooking it up to 5V (sorry for the blurry photo):

The problem with this, as you might be able to see, is that it doesn't require the power switch to be pressed down, and it also bypasses the emergency switch, both things that I fear shouldn't happen. Also, all the LEDs on board turn on, which I don't know yet if it's a failsafe or just a bug.

My next step is going to be trying to find the pins I need to interface with for the MAX232 chip this board has, and try to use the Glasgow to interface with it, see if I can read and/or write anything to it. Let's hope for the best...
